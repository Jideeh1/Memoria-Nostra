The world of Memoria Nostra takes place in a richly imagined higher-medieval time, where the familiar gives way to the extraordinary. A group of friends is mysteriously transported from Earth to the world of arcane and power, Aetheria. Here, they are thrust into a land brimming with magical experience quite literally, and martial prowess unlike anything they've ever known. What more could they want when all they've done was fantasize of being in a world exactly like this? But this land is no sunshine and rainbows only. Though the world brought an experience of a lifetime, it was inevitable to have the thought dawn on them. Could they go back to Earth? Or will they be stuck in Aetheria forever? So as they explore Aetheria, their end-goal remains the same: Go back to their world.

Memoria Nostra utilizes [Ren'py](https://www.renpy.org/), a python game launcher made specifically for making Visual Novels. While it is meant to be a story-packed game, it features JRPG battle system gameplays——mainly [turn-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_video_game) combat system. Developed by four people, this passion project have gone through extra yards of trial and errors to bring you a story and gameplay worth playing to the end.
